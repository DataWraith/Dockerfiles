## Other cool Dockerfiles

If you're browsing this repository, you may be interested in other cool
Dockerfiles as well:

* [sameersbn/browser-box](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-browser-box)

    Containerized Chrome/Chromium/Firefox/Tor-Browser

* [docker-gitolite](https://github.com/hlj/docker-gitolite)

    Gitolite hosts git repositories, and is itself configured through cloning
    and editing a git repository. Very convenient, and the docker image makes
    it simple to setup.

* [jbarlow83/ocrmypdf](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF)

    A program with a lot of dependencies, packaged as a Docker container. It
    performs Omnifont Character Recognition on PDF files.

* [jess/pandoc](https://github.com/jfrazelle/dockerfiles/tree/master/pandoc)

    `pandoc` is a universal markup converter. I mostly use it to convert
    `.html`-files into `.markdown`-files. It's written in Haskell and as such
    is a pain to build locally, so I'm glad it is available inside a container.
